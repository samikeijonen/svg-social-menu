# SVG Social Menu

[Justin Tadlock](http://themehybrid.com/) have invented [social nav menu](http://justintadlock.com/archives/2013/08/14/social-nav-menus-part-2) system. Pretty much everybody is using it.

But lately I've been thinking can we use SVG icons in Social Menu instead of icon fonts. There are several articles about SVG vs icon fonts:

* [Seriously, Don’t Use Icon Fonts](http://blog.cloudfour.com/seriously-dont-use-icon-fonts/)
* [Our SVG Icon Process](http://blog.cloudfour.com/our-svg-icon-process/)
* [Inline SVG vs Icon Fonts](https://css-tricks.com/icon-fonts-vs-svg/)
* [Bulletproof Accessible Icon Fonts](https://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/bulletproof_icon_fonts.html)
* [Tips for Creating Accessible SVG](http://www.sitepoint.com/tips-accessible-svg/)

This theme is showcasing that we can use SVG icons in Social Menu.
